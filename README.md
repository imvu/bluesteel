### How BlueSteel source code is organized ###

All the BlueSteel code lives inside the `app/` folder and it is divided into 2 parts:

- Presenter
- Logic

The **Presneter** folder contains all the code that builds the html front web page, contains the Json public API, deals with urls, and utilizes all the apps located on the `logic/` folder to handle the data properly. All the code that interacts with the user should live in this folder.

The **Logic** folder contains all the internal apps, each of these apps is in charge of handle BlueSteel's internal data. No public API calls / Urls / Views are allowed at this level. The majority of the apps tries to follow the pattern of Controller - Model, where the Controller holds almost all the logic to interact with the models.

## What is BlueSteel ##

- BlueSteel is a tool that help us track the performance of a given project. To achieve that goal, BlueSteel uses 4 concepts: `Layouts + Projects`, `Workers`, `Definitions`, `Executions`.

- `Layouts + Projects`: A *Layout* is a group of projects, and a *Project* is the information that BlueSteel will use to *clone*, *pull*, *identify* where the source code lives, and check the *state* of the project (Active or Inactive). We will need to setup a Layout and a project if we want to use BlueSteel.

- `Workers`: A *Worker* is a software downloaded from BlueSteel and capable of communicating back and forth with BlueSteel. This worker will accomplish several tasks like: 

    - Clone and/or pull an existing project.
    - Checkout the project at the correct commit.
    - Execute the right benchmark for that commit.
    - Report back the results of that benchmark to BlueSteel.

- `Definitions`: A *Benchmark Definition* is a list of commands that a worker will execute sequentially and will report back to BlueSteel. Normally a Benchmark Definition will be executed per every combination of commit and worker present in BlueSteel. This can be controlled on the benchmark definition setup.

- `Executions`: A *Benchmark Execution* is the result of all the executed commands present on a Benchmark Definition. Those results will provide enough information to BlueSteel to represent visual results and to generate notifications in the case of a fluctuation.


## Working with BlueSteel ##

### How to setup a Layout in BlueSteel ###

- Go to the main page: `localhost:28028`
- Click on `Layout` tab.
- Click on `+ Add Layout` button.
    - After the Layout is created, you will see that a default Project is created as well and associated with this layout.
    - Each project will represent a project in a git repository.
    - You can add as many projects as needed. Sometimes we need more projects to allow benchmark scripts of a Project B to benchmark old commits of Project A.

**1.- Layout setup**

- Setup a proper name for your layout.
- Select the project where all its commits will be benchmarked from BlueSteel.
- Click `Save` to save the layout information.

**2.- Project setup**

- Select a proper name for the project.
- Select a local path where the `.git` folder will be found inside the project.
    - This path indicates the git repository where all the commits will be benchmarked.
    - The default value is `.`, but you can specify another local path in the case you have many git repositories inside your project.
- Add/Modify all the commands necessary to clone this project.
    - BlueSteel workers will use this commands the first time to clone this project.
- Add/Modify all the commands necessary to fetch commits.
    - BlueSteel workers will use this commands to fetch commits, the default commands should be good to go.
- Click `Save`.

**3.- Layout Activation**

- Select `ACTIVE` on the layout setup properties.
- Click `Save`.

### How to setup a Worker in BlueSteel ###

**1.- Worker Download process**

- Go to the main page: `localhost:28028`
- Click on `Workers` tab.
- Click on `Download Worker` button.
- Uncompress the downloaded file to some convenient location.
- Execute `python core/Worker.py --auto-update=yes`
- The worker was designed to take care of everything, so at this point, everything should be working.

**2.- Worker Configuration**

- Click on `Workers` tab.
- Select the desired worker and click `Edit` button.
- Edit the description of the worker.
- Select if this worker will feed commits to BlueSteel.
    - It is recommended to only have 1 feeder, more than one will not provide any advantage.
- Select the maximum amount of reports to keep.
    - If the reports are extensive in size, it is recommended to keep as few as possible.
- Click `Save` button.

### How to setup a Benchmark Definitions in BlueSteel ###

**1.- Benchmark Definition Setup**

- Go to the main page: `localhost:28028`
- Click on `Definitions` tab.
- Click on `+ Add Definition` button.
- Click on `Edit` button of the new created definition.
- Select a proper name for the definition.
- Select the `Layout` that the definition will be referring to.
- Select the `Project` that the definition will run its commands on.
- Add/Modify the commands that will be executed for this definition.
- Select the required maximum amount of fluctuation between Benchmark Executions to send a notification (email) to the commit author.
- Add fluctuation overrides if necessary.
- Select the maximum weeks old a commit can be to rise a notification if a fluctuation happens.
- Click `Save` button.

While adding commands, you can use `{command_hash}` string. This string will be replaced by the current git commit hash.
For example, we can define the list of commands of one Benchmark Definition as:

    git checkout {commit_hash}
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    s/build_project
    s/benchmark_project

These commands will be executed for every commit replacing the `{commit_hash}` by the proper value, for example:

    git checkout 0000100001000010000100001000010000100001
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    s/build_project
    s/benchmark_project


**2.- Benchmark Executions**

For every benchmark definition and every commit of that benchmark definition's project, BlueSteel will create a Benchmark Execution. A Benchmark Execution will hold the results of the commands specified on the Benchmark Definition.

BlueSteel can understand 3 types of outputs now:

**Text**

If the output of a command is a json string with the form below, BlueSteel will show a text on the benchmark execution page. In this case, "data" field should be a string.


```
#!python

{
    "id" : <id_here>
    "visual_type" : "text",
    "data" : "This is a text that will be shown on the result page."
}
```

**Vertical Bars**

If the output of a command is a json string that follows the form below, BlueSteel will show a chart with vertical bars representing the "data" property. In this case, the "data" field should be a vector of numbers.


```
#!python

{
    "id" : <id_here>
    "visual_type" : "vertical_bars",
    "data" : [28, 28, 29, 30, 30]
}
```

- In the case of vertical bars, BlueSteel knows how to stack them to visualize in a single chart many commits. This is helpful to see which is the performance across several commits.

**Unknown output**

If the command output is something different than the previous two types (text, vertical_bars), BlueSteel will mark the output as an unknown type and will show the output as it is in the result page.
