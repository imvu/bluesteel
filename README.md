# BlueSteel (Beta) #

## What is BlueSteel ?##

- BlueSteel is a tool to help track your project performance per commit, per branch and per machine.

## How BlueSteel works ?##

- BlueSteel will benchmark every commit of your project, and will notify you if there is a fluctuation. To achieve that goal, BlueSteel uses 4 concepts: `Layouts + Projects`, `Workers`, `Definitions` and `Executions`.

- `Layouts + Projects`: A *Layout* is a group of projects, and a *Project* is the information that BlueSteel will use to *clone*, *pull*, *identify* where the source code lives, and check the *state* of the project (Active or Inactive). We will need to setup a Layout and a Project if we want to use BlueSteel.

- `Workers`: A *Worker* is a software downloaded from BlueSteel and capable of communicating back and forth with it. This worker will accomplish several tasks like: 

    - Clone and/or pull an existing project into the worker´s host machine.
    - Setup the project´s source code state at the correct commit.
    - Execute the right benchmark for that commit.
    - Report back the results of that benchmark to BlueSteel.

- `Definitions`: A *Benchmark Definition* is a list of commands that a worker will execute sequentially and will report back to BlueSteel. Normally a Benchmark Definition will be executed per every combination of commit and worker present in BlueSteel. This can be controlled on the Benchmark Definition's setup page.

- `Executions`: A *Benchmark Execution* is the result of all the executed commands present on a Benchmark Definition. Those results will provide enough information to BlueSteel to represent visual charts and to generate notifications in the case of fluctuations.

## Why use BlueSteel ?##

- It reduces the time required to fix a performance regression by quickly informing which is the problematic commit.
- The Commit Author (supposedly who has the most context on the affected code) will get a notification with benchmark reports to help him fix the issue.
- Improves confidence with branch experiments by comparing its performance with stable ones.

### Installation ###
 
- Create bluesteel project folder: `mkdir bluesteel`
- Get the code: `git clone git://github.com:imvu/bluesteel.git bluesteel`
- Install requisits: `cd bluesteel`, `s/install-bluesteel.py`
- Test everything is ok: `s/test-bluesteel.py`

### How to run tests? ###

- For running tests you simply need to execute: `s/test-bluesteel.py`
- If you want to run an specific set of tests, you can do: `s/test-bluesteel.py <set_name>`

### How to run BlueSteel (development) ###

- Execute command: `s/run-server.py`
- Open a browser and type the url: `localhost:28028`
- See next step `How to edit things inside BlueSteel`

### How to run BlueSteel (production) ###

- Execute command: `s/run-server.py` with parameter `--mode=production` and `--open=yes`
- Open a browser and type the url: `localhost:8080`
- See next step `How to edit things inside BlueSteel`
- You can also specify `--port` if you want it to run on another port. 

### How to edit things inside BlueSteel ###

- Create a super user (if you don't have one) with: `./manage.py createsuperuser`
- Open a browser and go to: `localhost:28028/admin/`
- Make login with your super user.
- Now you have privileges to create Layouts, Projects, Benchmark Definitions, etc.


## Working with BlueSteel ##

### How to setup a Layout in BlueSteel ###

- Go to the main page: `localhost:28028`
- Click on `Layout` tab.
- Click on `+ Add Layout` button.
    - After the Layout is created, you will see that a default Project is created as well and associated with that Layout.
    - Each Project will represent a Project in a git repository.
    - You can add as many Projects as needed. Sometimes we need more Projects to allow benchmark scripts of a Project B to benchmark old commits of Project A.

**1.- Layout setup**

- Setup a proper name for your Layout.
- Select the Project where all its commits will be benchmarked from BlueSteel.
- Click `Save` to save the Layout information.

**2.- Project setup**

- Select a proper name for the Project.
- Select a local path where the `.git` folder will be found inside the Project.
    - This path indicates the git repository where all the commits will be benchmarked.
    - The default value is `.`, but you can specify another local path in the case you have many git repositories inside your Project.
- Add/Modify all the commands necessary to clone this Project.
    - BlueSteel workers will use these commands the first time to clone this Project.
- Add/Modify all the commands necessary to fetch commits.
    - BlueSteel workers will use these commands to fetch commits, the default commands should be good to go.
- Click `Save`.

**3.- Layout Activation**

- Select `ACTIVE` on the Layout setup properties.
- Click `Save`.

### How to setup a Worker in BlueSteel ###

**1.- Worker Download Process**

- Go to the main page: `localhost:28028`
- Click on `Workers` tab.
- Click on `Download Worker` button.
- Uncompress the downloaded file to some convenient location.
- Execute `python core/Worker.py --auto-update=yes`
- The Worker was designed to take care of everything, so at this point, everything should be working.

**2.- Worker Configuration**

- Click on `Workers` tab.
- Select the desired Worker and click `Edit` button.
- Edit the description of the Worker.
- Select if this Worker will feed commits to BlueSteel.
    - It is recommended to only have 1 feeder, more than one will not provide any advantage.
- Select the maximum amount of reports to keep.
    - If the reports are extensive in size, it is recommended to keep as few as possible.
- Click `Save` button.

### How to setup a Benchmark Definitions in BlueSteel ###

**1.- Benchmark Definition Setup**

- Go to the main page: `localhost:28028`
- Click on `Definitions` tab.
- Click on `+ Add Definition` button.
- Click on `Edit` button of the new created Definition.
- Select a proper name for the Definition.
- Select the `Layout` that the Definition will be referring to.
- Select the `Project` that the Definition will run its commands on.
- Add/Modify the commands that will be executed for this Definition.
- Select the required maximum amount of fluctuation percent (%) between Benchmark Executions to send a notification (email) to the commit author.
- Add fluctuation overrides if necessary.
- Select the maximum weeks that an old commit can be to rise a notification if a fluctuation happens.
- Click `Save` button.

While adding commands, you can use `{command_hash}` string. This string will be replaced by the current git commit hash.
For example, we can define the list of commands of one Benchmark Definition as:

        git checkout {commit_hash}
        git submodule update --init --recursive
        s/build_project
        s/benchmark_project

These commands will be executed for every commit replacing the `{commit_hash}` by the proper value, for example:

        git checkout 0000100001000010000100001000010000100001
        git submodule update --init --recursive
        s/build_project
        s/benchmark_project


**2.- Benchmark Executions**

For every Benchmark Definition and every commit of that Benchmark Definition's Project, BlueSteel will create a Benchmark Execution. A Benchmark Execution will hold the results of the executed commands specified on the Benchmark Definition.

BlueSteel can understand 3 types of outputs now:

- **Text**

    If the output of a command is a JSON string with the form below, BlueSteel will show a text on the Benchmark Execution page. In this case, "data" field should be a string.


```
#!python

    {
        "id" : <id_here>
        "visual_type" : "text",
        "data" : "This is a text that will be shown on the result page."
    }
```

- **Vertical Bars**

    If the output of a command is a JSON string that follows the form below, BlueSteel will show a chart with vertical bars representing the "data" property. In this case, the "data" field should be a vector of numbers.

    In the case of vertical bars, BlueSteel knows how to stack them to visualize in a single chart many commits. This is helpful to see which is the performance across several commits.


```
#!python

    {
        "id" : <id_here>
        "visual_type" : "vertical_bars",
        "data" : [28, 28, 29, 30, 30]
    }
```

- **Unknown output**

    If the command output is something different than the previous two types (text and vertical_bars), BlueSteel will mark the output as an unknown type and will show the output as it is in the result page.


### How to use PostgreSQL database in BlueSteel (optional)###

*Using PostgreSQL will help BlueSteel handle better multiple requests at the same time. SQLite will perform worst in that scenario*

- Go to [http://postgresapp.com](http://postgresapp.com) and download the app.
- Install it! (in OS X means to move it to the Applications folder)
- Locate `pg_config` binary. It should live inside: `/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.5/bin/`
- add that path to $PATH environment variable with: `PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.5/bin/`
- (Linux only) install postgres development package: `sudo apt-get install libpq-dev python-dev`
- Install psycopg2 with: `sudo pip install psycopg2==2.6.2`
- Open a PostgreSQL shell. 
    * in macOS you can open the Postgres App shell through the icon.
    * in Linux you can execute:
        * `sudo su - postgres`
        * `psql -d postgres`
- Execute command: `CREATE DATABASE bluesteeldb;`
- Execute command: `CREATE USER bluesteeluser;`
- Execute command: `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE bluesteeldb TO bluesteeluser;`
- Execute command: `ALTER USER bluesteeluser CREATEDB;`
- Execute command: `ALTER USER bluesteeluser WITH PASSWORD 'pass';`
- Execute command: `SET effective_cache_size TO '1000 MB';`
- Modify the values of the previous commands as you need.
- Modify Django settings files to use this DB instead of SQLite.
- Execute command: `./manage.py migrate`

### How to dump PostgreSQL database data (optional)

- This is only necessary in the case you want to migrate data from one database to another.
- Stop the BlueSteel webpage (kill the process started with s/run-server.py)
- Login with the postgres user: `sudo su - postgres`
- Use pg_dump to dump all the data: `pg_dump bluesteeldb > data_dump.sql`

### How to restore PostgreSQL database data (optional)

- This is only necessary in the case you want to import data from a previous database.
- Stop the BlueSteel webpage (kill the process started with s/run-server.py)
- Login with the postgres user: `sudo su - postgres`
- Open the Postgreswl shell: `psql -d -postgres`
- Execute command: `DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS bluesteeldb;`
- Execute command: `CREATE DATABASE bluesteeldb;`
- Execute command: `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE bluesteeldb TO bluesteeluser;`
- Execute command: `SET effective_cache_size TO '1000 MB';`
- Quit the shell with: `\q`
- Import data with: `psql bluesteeldb < data_dump.sql`


## Contributing ##

### Commit convention ###

- Make commits as atomic and small as possible.
- Write tests for all the code you write.
- Make a pull request and submit it.

### How BlueSteel source code is organized ###

All the BlueSteel code lives inside the `app/` folder and it is divided into 2 parts:

- Presenter
- Logic

The **Presenter** folder contains all the code that builds the HTML front web page, contains the JSON public API, deals with URLs, and utilizes all the apps located in the `logic/` folder to handle the data properly. All the code that interacts with the user/customer should live in this folder.

The **Logic** folder contains all the internal apps, each of these apps is in charge of handle BlueSteel's internal data. Neither public API calls, URLs, nor Views are allowed at this level. The majority of the apps try to follow the pattern of Controller - Model, where the Controller holds almost all the logic to interact with the models.
